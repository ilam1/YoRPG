# NEW!
1 - Unsure about what is special about each character?
We give you the FULL CHARACTER DESCRIPTION + stats upon your choosing a character. If you're unsatisfied/ want to browse more/ made a mistake in your decision, you can now GO BACK TO THE SELECTION MANUAL! We also REMOVED THE DEFAULT WARRIOR that occurs when you select a number greater than the number of choices provided, to an invalid statement that brings you back to the selection manual.

2 - We've included a BOSS MONSTER!
No longer will you meander through five encounters and end the game dissatisfied from not meeting a monster/ dying of exhaustion(?).
You can now leave as a hero having conquered a boss (with a ton of HP and very random attack stats)!
Of course, the game is not for the faint hearted, since the only way you can win is beating the boss.

3 - Ambivalent about the character stats?
Characters now have NEW STATS and SPECIALIZE abilites that reflect the character's nature:
Specialized Attacks:
 - Warrior: Increases attack but decreases defense
 - Mage: Massively increases attack
 - Ranger: Increases attack and defense by a little
 - Rogue: Increases attack by a little but decreases defense by a little
 - Paladin: Massively increases defense
